'''
Misha wants to climb a staircase consisting of n stairs. 
In one step she can either climb one or two stairs. 
But, Misha wants the total number of steps taken 
at the end of the staircase to be divisible by a number m.

? min number of steps need to take to climb 

input :
The first line contains the integer: n
The second line contains the integer: m

output:
pirnt a single number - the min number of steps divisible by m
if there is no way to climb the staris while satisfying the requirements, then pirnt -1
constraints
1<=n<=100000
1<=m<=10
